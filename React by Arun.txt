REACT
-----

ES6 features

1.jsx
2.components

4.props

components=>reusable codes.

in b/w the function and return statements we have to write the js codes.

DOM=>document object model.

js follows real DOM
react follows virtual DOM

use of react
1.improves performance.
2.reduces rendering time.

components are of two types:
1.class components.
2.functional components.

class components:
1.inbuild life cycle methods.

functional components:
1.no life cycle methods in it,it is an plain component.
2.hooks.
3.we use useEffect hook for lifecycle methods in functional component.
syntax of useEffect  useEffect(()=>{initialization},[dependencies])=>two arguments

node modules=>important for the project to run.

BABLE and WEBPACK=>it is an compiler.

react.strictMode=>prevent from crashes(runtime errors).

Every component should return only one Element.

Every component should have one fragment (or)wrapping tag.


STATE:
-----
1.for storing data in component level not in app level.
2.useState.
synatx=>const[data,seData]=useState().=>it is an array with two parameters one is initialization and another one is for setting values.

PROPS:
-----
